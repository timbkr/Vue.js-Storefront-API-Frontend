# TODO:
# 1. Change VITE_STORE_URL & VITE_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN to your credentials
# 2. Rename this file into '.env'

# Info: 
# Vite is needed for the environment variables to work on client side (no step needed if you haven't removed Vite from the dependencies)
# If you dont want to use environment variables, go to '.\src\utils\graphQLClient.ts' and fill in your Store Credentials there

# Making use of Vite built in dotenv support (variables have to be prefixed with 'VITE' to work on client side)
